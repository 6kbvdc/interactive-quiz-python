Ultimate Quiz App


Description:
This project is a command line quiz application built with Python. It tests users in Math, Logic, and Python. The system tracks scores and ranks players on a leaderboard.



Problem:
Many students study passively. They need fast practice with feedback. This app gives timed questions, scores performance, and stores results so users measure progress.



Features:
• Multiple categories, Math, Logic, Python
• Difficulty levels, Easy, Medium, Hard
• 200 plus auto generated questions
• Random answer order each run
• Timer for each question
• Score calculation
• Leaderboard saved to file
• Runs on any Python 3 environment



Tools:
• Python 3
• random
• time
• os
• datetime



How to run:
• Install Python 3 or Pydroid 3
• Open the project folder
• Run python quiz_system.py
• Enter your name and start the quiz


Project files:
• quiz_system.py, main program
• results.txt, saved scores
• README.md, documentation


What I learned:
• Control flow with loops and conditions
• Functions and modular design
• File handling
• Timers and user input
• Building a full console application

How I used AI:
I used ChatGPT as a learning assistant to understand syntax, debug errors, and improve code structure. I designed and implemented the application myself.
